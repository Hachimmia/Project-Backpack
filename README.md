Project-Backpack is a group project that happened during my HND year 1 of web development at Edinburgh College in 2022.

The project is about a pitch to present to a new start-up company, in the luxury products field.

Our group of 5 people decide to make a modular backpack as a luxury product. 
We split the roles and my role was the project manager and the designer. 
I made all the graphics, logo, and decided on parts of the design layout for the website.
